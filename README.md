# CS-230
Repository of my work for SNHU CS-230 Operating Platforms
_________________________________________________________________________________

The Gaming Room is a company that had a game called Draw it or Lost it for Android. The Gaming Room wanted their game to expand to other platforms.

I kept everything in the document concise and organized.

I found that the document kept me working in scope when following the design document.

I would revise my recommendations in the document by going more in detail in why I would recommend them.

I split apart the functionality of the game so that there would be less work spend porting the software to other platforms while the core game stays the same.
The users are the one who have the final say on whether the product is good or not. Which is why they user's needs are important to consider.

I focus on the documentation providing an outline of features and not adding onto scope.
